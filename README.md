# Language Identification (2016)

This repository contains a lightweight **Language Identification** tool developed in 2016. 

### Overview
The project explores how statistical language models can identify a text's language with minimal computational overhead. It focuses on distinguishing between various languages using character-level distributions.

### Approach
* **Character N-grams:** Utilizing character sequences to create unique linguistic profiles for each language.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Implementing frequency-based classification to predict the most likely language for a given input string.
